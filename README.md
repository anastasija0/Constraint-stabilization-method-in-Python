# Motion of a Ball on a Rotating Parabolic Wire: Lagrange Multiplier Method

This project explores the dynamics of a ball placed on a wire shaped like a parabola, which rotates around its axis of symmetry at a constant angular velocity. The aim was to derive the equations of motion using the Lagrange multiplier method for constrained systems, reformulate them as a system of differential equations using the Constraint Stabilization method, and analyze the motion through visualizations of key quantities.

# Key Libraries:
**NumPy:** Utilized for numerical calculations, particularly in solving systems of differential equations, handling matrices, and performing vectorized operations for efficient computation.

**SciPy:** Applied for solving the system of differential equations derived from the Lagrangian, using robust numerical solvers.

**Matplotlib:** Employed for generating and analyzing graphs that represent the ball's motion, velocities, and other relevant physical quantities.

# Key Features:

_**Lagrange Multiplier Method:**_ This method is used to derive the equations of motion for a system under constraints, forming the core of the project.

_**Constraint Stabilization:**_ The system of equations is transformed using this method to stabilize the constraints and ensure physically meaningful solutions.

_**Numerical Simulation and Visualization:**_ Python libraries are combined to simulate the motion and visualize the results, providing insights into the behavior of the system over time.

# Project Context:
This project was completed as part of the course Dynamics of Mechanical Systems and was a collaboration with two other students. It serves as a practical application of theoretical concepts to model and simulate real-world mechanical systems.
