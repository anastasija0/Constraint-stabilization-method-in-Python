# Lagrange multiplier method project
This is a project I did with two of my friends for the course Dynamics of Mechanical Systems.
In this experiment, we studied the motion of a ball placed on a wire shaped like a parabola which rotates around its axis of symmetry with a constant angular velocity.
The goal of the experiment is to derive the equations of motion using the Lagrange multiplier method for solving constrained optimization problems, represent them as a system of differential equations via the Constraint Stabilization method, and then analyze graphs of relevant quantities.
We completed the project in Python using Numpy, Matplotlib and SciPy libraries.
